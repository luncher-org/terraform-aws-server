# Us-West-1 Example

This example has been validated using [Terratest](https://terratest.gruntwork.io/), a Go sdk and test suite for Terraform.
If you would like to test this example go to the ./tests directory and run the test with `go test region_test.go` or `go test -v -run TestUsWest1`.

This is an example of using this module to deploy a small sles15 server on AWS in the us-west-1 region.
